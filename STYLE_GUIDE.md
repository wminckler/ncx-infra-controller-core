# How to write Rust in bare-metal-manager-core

The goal of this document is to help keep our codebase consistent and maintainable by outlining best-practices we've
learned through experience. It is currently a mix of best practices for _this codebase_ (ie. how we expect code to
be organized), and best practices for *Rust in general*. The latter is mostly motivated by issues we seen enough to
warrant writing them down, but otherwise this document not aim to be a "how to write Rust" guide.

## Core Principles

- Prefer simple, explicit code over clever or heavily abstracted code. Optimize for readability and maintainability
  first.
- Prefer designs that are hard to misuse. The more the compiler can catch bugs, the better.
- Abstractions should justify their existence: Do not add abstractions "just in case". Wait until there is a real
  requirement for them.

## Reviewability

PR descriptions should be written as if the audience has no context for the change: Explain why it's happening.
Don't assume people are already aware of your feature roadmap.

Prefer to not land unused code if nobody's using it yet, unless not doing so would make for too large of a change to
review. For example, a PR that lands protobuf changes but without any code using it yet, makes for a lot of
guesswork during review: If we can't see how the code will be used, we are just guessing at what the best API
contract will be. Landing both changes together means we can look at it all holistically.

## Lints and Warnings

We enable all clippy lints by default, and treat all warnings as errors. If a warning or clippy lint is firing for
your code, strongly consider fixing it. Avoid using `#[allow(...)]` unless you have a strong reason to do so. New
code should generally not have to `#[allow]` any lints or warnings.

### A note on dead code

Dead code detection is important to catch mistakes and to avoid unused code building up and hurting
maintainability. Strongly avoid using `#[allow(dead_code)]`.

An exception is when a part of the codebase is not finished: If a new feature is too large to land all in one PR,
and is being written in phases, code may be merged with nothing calling it yet, and `#[allow(dead_code)]` is
necessary for it to be merged early.

Other common places where we've seen `#[allow(dead_code)]` that are not necessary:

- If a field or function is only used in tests: Use `#[cfg(test)]` to include it only in test builds.
- If a field is written to but never read, but needs to be held so its `Drop` impl does not run: Name it with an
  underscore to hint that it's not supposed to be read
- If a field is only used if certain crate features are enabled, prefer `#[cfg(feature = "feature")]` to only
  include it when that feature is being used.
- If a field isn't currently yet, but you want to leave it around as documentation on what fields could exist (like an
  unused database column, or unused JSON field), comment it out.
- Otherwise, strongly consider deleting the code.

## Metrics

When designing metrics, be careful with cardinality. Do not attach highly unique labels that explode time-series
count, like per-machine or per-instance attributes.

## Logging

When writing log messages, prefer placing common fields as attributes passed to tracing function, instead of using
string interpolation. For example:

```rust
fn avoid(machine_id: MachineId) {
    if let Err(e) = process_machine(machine_id) {
        tracing::error!("process_machine failed for {machine_id}: {e}");
    }
}
fn prefer(machine_id: MachineId) {
    if let Err(e) = process_machine(machine_id) {
        tracing::error!(%machine_id, error=%e, "process_machine failed");
    }
}

```

This helps in log parsing, especially when we want to find logs corresponding to a given machine_id. `error` and
`machine_id` are probably the two most important examples, but try to express other relevant data as fields instead of
using interpolation if it makes sense.

## Crate Features

Avoid using crate features unless there is a good reason. Our CI runners only build with the default features you get
from `cargo build --release`, meaning that if certain code breaks under certain combinations of crate features, it
might not get caught by CI. If we wanted to support numerous crate features, we would need CI runners to produce
checks for each meaningful combination of feature flags we support, which scales exponentially to the feature count.

Cases where features *are* warranted:

- For shared crates when only a subset of dependents need certain code: For example, the `carbide_uuid` is used by
  several dependents, but only the `carbide_api` crate needs the sqlx conversions. We don't want e.g.
  `carbide_admin_cli` to take a dependency on `sqlx`, so the sqlx conversions are behind a `sqlx` crate feature. But
  this is covered by CI tests, since CI builds both the admin-cli and the api crate, both sets of features are
  exercised.

- For supporting non-linux builds: The `carbide_api` crate needs to use types from the `tss-esapi` crate to support
  validating secure-boot keys, but `tss-esapi` only builds on Linux. To support developers running `carbide_api` on
  their Mac for testing, the parts which require `tss-esapi` are carefully carved out into a `linux-build` feature
  (which is enabled by default). We do not run CI tests with this feature disabled, so supporting a build without
  `linux-build` enabled is best-effort.

## Async code

Due to the "virality" of async code, prefer synchronous versions of abstractions if both are available. For instance,
prefer a `std::sync::Mutex` to a `tokio::sync::Mutex` if either will work for you, so that you don't need to make
your interface `async` just so you can use the tokio Mutex. That way callers can call you without needing to be
async themselves. Async work should generally be traceable to some I/O or timer that needs to be used, otherwise
code should typically be synchronous.

## Database transactions

Transactions should be used to group write operations together such that they can be rolled back on failure. But do
not hold a transaction open while doing long-running work. Doing so can exhaust the connection pool if the thing
you're awaiting is blocked or slow. We have a custom lint, `txn_held_across_await` which will catch cases where you're
`await`ing a future while holding a transaction, which mitigates this. If it happens, your
code needs to be fixed, do not `#[allow(txn_held_across_await)]`.

## Database wrappers

- Type definitions: The code in `crates/api-db` is intended to wrap database calls, whereas `crates/api-model` should
  contain the actual model definitions. In the api-db crate, prefer bare functions that take a model as an argument, to
  OO-style methods on db-specific types. This allows the model types to live in a separate model crate, without the
  temptation for an OO-style database type to become a quasi-model unto itself.

- Read vs Write: Prefer accepting a `impl DbReader` as a connection if your database function is read-only. This allows
  callers to pass a `PgPool` and avoid needing boilerplate to begin a transaction and commit it just to call a
  read-only function.

## General Rust Coding Standards

### Mutability

Prefer immutable data when possible. Mutable data can be hard to reason about if it's being reused multiple times,
and it's not clear when mutations are supposed to "stop". For example:

```rust
fn example(machines: Vec<Machine>) {
    let mut index: HashMap<MachineId, &Machine> = HashMap::new();
    for machine in &machines {
        index[machine.id] = machine;
        do_something_else_with(machine);
    }

    process_machines(&index);

    // Someone comes in later and adds:
    let another_machine = lookup_machine();
    index[another_machine.id] = another_machine;
    // Hmm, do I need to call `process_machines` again? Or will that process the same machines twice?
    process_machines(&index);
}
```

If data is left mutable (like `index` above), it's not clear at a given line of code if the data is "done" being
built, or still has more writes to go. It's also not clear whether it's safe to use the partially-written `index`. And
interleaving the construction of `index` with other side-effects (like `do_something_else_with(machine)`) makes it
unclear what the role of certain code is.

When building a Vec or a HashMap, prefer using iterators to building them from a for-loop:

```rust
fn example(machines: Vec<Machine>) {
    // index is immutable
    let index: HashMap<MachineId, &Machine> = machines.iter().map(|machine| {
        (machine.id, machine)
    }).collect();

    for machine in &machines {
        do_something_else_with(machine); // it's clear this is unrelated to constructing the index
    }

    // it's clear the index is now fully-built
    process_machines(&index);

    // This will now fail to compile, making it clear you have to move this to the beginning and use
    // `machines.iter().chain(Some(another_machine))` to include it in the original index.
    let another_machine = lookup_machine();
    index[another_machine.id] = another_machine;
}
```

### Initialization

Prefer struct literals for "plain old data", and only add a `new()` function if your type has fields which need to be
non-public. Prefer a Builder pattern only if your `new()` function is too large or difficult to call.

Reasoning: Struct literals include named fields which aid in readability, versus a `new()` function which does not have
labels for parameters. Builders can be more readable than a large `new()` function, but sacrifice compile-time
checks if any of the fields are required.

Compare:

```rust
fn example() {
    let u = User {
        id: "john",
        full_name: "John Smith",
    };
}
```

to:

```rust
fn example() {
    let u = User::new("john", "John Smith");
}
```

In the former it is clear what each argument is, whereas the latter you have to memorize which positional argument
corresponds to what field.

For types that are not simple plain-old-data, for example "services" (like a redfish client), or any other case
where you don't want the caller to initialize certain fields, a `new()` function may be required:

```rust
struct RedfishClient {
    // Callers pass this
    url: Url,
    // Callers don't pass this
    inner: HttpClient,
}

impl RedfishClient {
    fn new(url: Url) {
        Self { url, inner: make_http_client(url) }
    }
}
```

If your type has fields that can all be default values in the common case (like a Config object), prefer implementing
`Default` for the type and let callers call `T::default()`, instead of a parameterless `new()`.

If, in addition to not wanting callers to initialize certain fields, you also have a large number of fields that can
to be passed, consider adding a Builder type.

```rust
struct BigService {
    name: String,
    // ... lots of fields
}

struct BigServiceBuilder {
    name: Option<String>, // careful!
    // .. lots of Option<T> fields
}

impl BigServiceBuilder {
    fn name(mut self, name: String) -> Self {
        self.name = Some(name);
        self
    }

    fn build(self) -> BigService {
        BigService {
            name: self.name.expect("caller didn't provide name"), // oops!
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

But be aware that this can sacrifice compile-time safety if any of the builder fields are required to construct the
object. You can work around this by requiring callers to pass any required fields in order to construct a builder:

```rust
impl BigService {
    fn builder(name: String) -> BigServiceBuilder {
        BigServiceBuilder {
            name,
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

But as the number of required fields grows, a builder becomes less and less helpful in the first place. Builders
are most helpful when all fields are optional or have defaults, and are less helpful if there are a complex mix of
required and non-required fields. If you have a large struct with lots of required fields and lots of non-required
fields, consider splitting it into two types, one for the required fields, and a `Config` or `Params` type for the
non-required (defaultable) ones.

### Type Conversions

Prefer implementing `From` or `TryFrom` for types, rather than writing bespoke `.to_foo()` methods on objects. This
makes your conversion logic more idiomatic and discoverable (e.g. you can write `src.into()`) than custom methods.

Exception: Avoid implementing `From` for a borrowed reference to your type, e.g. `From<&Type>`. This is more awkward
for callers to trigger (e.g. `(&foo).into()`) and isn't really what the From/Into are supposed to be used for.

If you need to convert from a string representation, prefer `FromStr` to `From<String>` or `From<&str>`. This lets
callers call `.parse()`, which can be given a `&str` slice, which can avoid needless clones.

### Fields and getters

Avoid writing getters like `.some_field()` for a type, and prefer just making that field public.

The reason for this is specific to Rust and its ownership model: Public fields allow _partial moves_ of an object to
take ownership of its fields, whereas getters have to pick an ownership model that might not match what the caller
needs.

For example, if a type `User` has a field `pub name: String`, callers that own a User have several options for
reading the name field:

```rust
fn example(u: User) {
    foo(&u.name); // borrow `name`
    bar(u.name.clone()); // clone `name`
    baz(u.name); // partial move of `name` out of `u`
}
```

Whereas if `name()` were a getter, you have to pick an ownership model:

```rust
impl User {
    // By borrow: But callers have to clone if they need an owned string
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }

    // By cloned value: If callers only need to borrow, this clone is wasteful
    fn name(&self) -> String {
        self.name.clone()
    }

    // By transferring ownership: Now callers have to move `self` to get the name, and can no longer access other fields
    fn name(self) -> String {}
}
```

In cases where you don't want a field to be public for other reasons (like not allowing callers to write to it), and
you must write a getter, consider making two versions, a borrowed getter and an `into_` getter:

```rust
impl User {
    // Borrowed version
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        &self.name
    }

    // Owned/destructured version
    fn into_name(self) -> String {
        self.name
    }
}
```

or an `into_parts` function, if you want to return multiple fields at once. But again, `pub` fields are
simplest and can avoid all of this, if you are able to use them.

### Avoid needless clones

Seeing `.clone()` all over is a sign that the ownership model may need some rethinking. Can you borrow the data
instead? Can you take ownership of the value you're cloning?

Common usages of clone that have easy fixes:

- Borrowing: Sometimes a clone happens because you have a borrow and need an owned value:

```rust
fn takes_string(s: String) {
    println!("{s}");
}

fn example(s: &str) {
    takes_string(s.clone()); // takes_string requires ownership so we have to clone
}
```

But the `takes_string` function doesn't truly need an owned string, it can be changed to take a `&str` as well.

Or conversely, `example` could be changed to take an owned String.

- Iterators: You can use `.into_iter()` instead of `.iter()` to an an owned version of each value, which you can then
  move without cloning:

```rust
fn takes_string(s: String) {}

fn avoid(v: Vec<String>) {
    v.iter().for_each(|i| takes_string(i.clone())); // avoid: needless clone
}

fn prefer(v: Vec<String>) {
    v.into_iter().for_each(|i| takes_string(i)); // prefer: moves out of v
}
```

- Struct initialization ordering: Sometimes just moving the order of parameters to a struct literal can avoid a clone:

```rust
struct Outer {
    inner: Inner,
    id: uint
}

struct Inner {
    name: String,
    id: uint
}

fn avoid(inner: I) -> Outer {
    Outer {
        inner: inner.clone(), // can't move inner yet, still need inner.id?
        id: inner.id,
    }
}

fn prefer(inner: I) -> Outer {
    Outer {
        id: inner.id, // Better: just swap the parameters and we can move inner last
        inner,
    }
}
```

- Making use of `Cow<T>`: If you might use a borrowed value or might produce your own, consider using `Cow` to avoid
  the clone in the borrowed case.

```rust
fn avoid(user: Option<&User>) -> User {
    if let Some(u) = user {
        u.clone()
    } else {
        User::default()
    }
}

fn prefer(user: Option<&User>) -> Cow<'_, User> {
    if let Some(u) = user {
        Cow::Borrowed(u)
    } else {
        Cow::Owned(User::default())
    }
}
```

### Error handling

Prefer custom errors for library crates, using the `thiserror` crate to reduce boilerplate for declaring them. Use
automatic conversions to convert between errors, or `.map_err()` if you have to. Using `eyre` is acceptable for crates
that are used for tests/mocks, or for toplevel binaries where errors are given to the user for informational purposes,
and not intended to be inspected by other rust code. (We do not always adhere to this rule.)

Avoid using `let _unused = foo();` to discard errors. This is error-prone: If later `foo()` is refactored to become
an async function, assigning the result to `_unused` silences the compiler warning telling you forgot to call `.await`.
If you don't care about the errors a function produces, prefer using `.ok()` to convert the error into a
(discardable) Option.

```rust
fn fails() -> Result<(), Error> {}

fn avoid() {
    // if somebody makes `fails()` async later, the compiler won't complain, and the future will
    // never get run
    let _dontcare = fails();
}

fn prefer() {
    // if somebody makes `fails()` async later, you get a compiler error
    fails().ok();
}
```
